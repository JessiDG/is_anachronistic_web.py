Future update plans:
- Integrate with the Project Gutenberg API to allow for users to select their own time periods and build dataasets dynamically
- Integrate with the Google Ngram API to allow users to see the graphs of the chronicity of their word choices; possibly Google Ngram could replace Project Gutenberg as a source
